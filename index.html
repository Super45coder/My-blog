They also give you a small free cake for your birthday! And they have screens that can be used to pay for food and to play games! This is useful to pass the time for kids while they wait. They serve amazing food and I want to eat there almost every day! That is how good Olive Garden is. So go there and come out happy and satisfied!</p>

The Grand Canyon is in Arizona and has a map so you can go through the national park. It also has some stores to buy some games, like puzzles, and artifacts, like rocks and keychains. It provides great scenery and has many railings, so nobody falls. Did you know that the Grand Canyon emerged from a Native American making a hole and putting water in as a trap? Well, it's true. There also are many places where you can take pictures there. Now go! It will work out, I promise.</p>

            <p class="text-left text-muted">Downdown Denver is a great place and a city in Denver. It contains the capitol, and many goods and services. There are movie theaters and food stores as well! I have been there once, and it was excellent! The only thing I recommend is that there should be a parking lot every 3 or 5 miles or so, because Downdown is so crowded and you might not get space and will have to keep driving. It also leads to towns, not highways, which is good, because then downtown would be even more crowded and you would lose more parking space. </p>

                <p>This is a game show where 3 teams of 3 people compete to see who can get the most players over the lava on the floor to get to the exit! There is an obstacle course in different rooms, like the kitchen and basement, with levels. A player can easily fall into the lava with too much or too little momentum, too little grip, and more! There are countless ways to get to the exit, and there are a few hidden suprises to help you jump to a different platform(s)</p>

Covid is still not gone though, but with the dropping of Covid in the U.S, people have gotten hope that if he follow the precautions for Covid and get the vaccine, we can fight Covid and make it no longer exist in the country and maybe the entire world. After 2 years of Covid, we can finally defeat it. 2 years is nothing compared to the Spanish flu, which was our previous epidemic and went for 100 years. Finishing this in 2 years itself is a big accomplishment and deserves to be celebrated. </p>
