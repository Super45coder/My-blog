The Grand Canyon is in Arizona and has a map so you can go through the national park. It also has some stores to buy some games, like puzzles, and artifacts, like rocks and keychains. It provides great scenery and has many railings, so nobody falls. Did you know that the Grand Canyon emerged from a Native American making a hole and putting water in as a trap? Well, it's true. There also are many places where you can take pictures there. Now go! It will work out, I promise.</p>

            <p class="text-left text-muted">Downdown Denver is a great place and a city in Denver. It contains the capitol, and many goods and services. There are movie theaters and food stores as well! I have been there once, and it was excellent! The only thing I recommend is that there should be a parking lot every 3 or 5 miles or so, because Downdown is so crowded and you might not get space and will have to keep driving. It also leads to towns, not highways, which is good, because then downtown would be even more crowded and you would lose more parking space. </p>

A computer costs like, 500 to 1 thousand dollars. You will pay only 50 to 100 dollars for a lego set of a mario level and 10 dollars for the mini figure. This way, you can save around 400 dollars. This way is the best, as it will cause the same amount of fun as the computer game and is cheaper than the computer game of Mario and its levels. </p>
